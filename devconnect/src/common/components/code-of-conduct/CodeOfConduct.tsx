      <p className="big-text underline bold">Be Respectful to Speakers (and audiences)</p>
      <p>
        Be mindful of your volume when you&apos;re in or near event venues. Noise levels can quickly get out of control
        and become disruptive to the programme going on inside! Please respect the speakers and participants if you are
        arriving late to an event and/or getting up to leave an event early â€” try to cause as little disruption as
        possible.
      </p>

        including all safety instructions and requirements. It is also very important to note that <b>ALL</b> attendees
        are expected to conform to <b>ALL</b> local laws, including Covid-19 restrictions and policies imposed by the
        venue, facility, and/or local authorities.
      </p>
      <p className="big-text underline bold">How to Report</p>
