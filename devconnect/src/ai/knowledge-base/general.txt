Devconnect (NOT Devcon) 2025 is happening in Buenos Aires, Argentina on November 17th - 22nd. 

Devcon's location is TBD, but it will happen in 2026.

## **Why Buenos Aires**

🇦🇷 **Argentina—especially Buenos Aires—is one of the most crypto-active regions in the world.** With high inflation and financial restrictions, Ethereum and stablecoins have become essential tools for everyday transactions. Adoption is already widespread, and many projects and developers are based there.

The Argentine government has engaged with the Ethereum ecosystem, adopting blockchain-based solutions in various sectors. From a practical standpoint, Argentina is an ideal host, offering visa-friendly policies, accessibility, infrastructure, and a wide selection of venues for Devconnect events.

And the local Ethereum community has been advocating to host Devcon/nect for years.

## **What could Devconnect 2025 look like**

In Argentina, the seeds of Ethereum adoption have already been planted, and they’re beginning to flourish.

Devconnect 2025 should leverage Buenos Aires as a hub for a broader, ecosystem-wide effort to onboard the next wave of users. This could take the form of a **“World’s Fair” for Ethereum** — a real-world showcase of Ethereum’s impact on society.

It could feature a **co-work space**, integrated into a larger space filled with interactive demos, pavilions, and local business integrations. We would showcase and utilize onchain identity solutions, decentralized payments, privacy-preserving products, governance systems, d/acc tools, and more.

Devconnect 2025 would be a citywide showcase of tangible Ethereum applications, with the co-work space as a Schelling point, for the Ethereum community to thrive.
