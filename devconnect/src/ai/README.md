# Notes on using OpenAI

We would of course prefer to use open source alternatives for DevAI and have invested considerable resources toward this end; unfortunately open source AI is quite difficult to get right, and we weren't able to meet our high standards before Devcon 7 - a pragmatic decision was made to use OpenAI in this first iteration, but we will resume work on a fully open source implementation as soon as we are able

You can find the AI implementations in the devcon-api folder
