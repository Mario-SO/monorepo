  ### Devconnect Buenos Aires


  #### The community in Argentina has already laid strong foundations for
  Ethereum in their country. As the next step, they are planning to make
  Argentina the crypto capital of the world.


  ##### Argentina is leading the crypto adoption in Latin America and
  stablecoins have become an important tool for financial stability in
  Argentina. The Buenos Aires government has shown real dedication to Ethereum
  by using Quark ID - an official identification project built on Ethereum, and
  many teams building in Ethereum, like X and X are from Argentina.


  ##### By bringing Devconnect to Buenos Aires, we aim to highlight a pioneering
  community, celebrate their efforts, learn alongside them, and build the future
  of Ethereum together.
