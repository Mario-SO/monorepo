  ### What is Devconnect?


  #### Devconnect ARG is a week-long “Ethereum World’s Fair” across the city of
  Buenos Aires – a showcase of tangible Ethereum applications, with a coworking
  space as a Schelling point for the Ethereum community to thrive.


  ##### For six days, the Cowork will take place at[ La
  Rural](https://larural.com.ar/inicio-visitante/), serving as the central
  meeting point where you can test out live Ethereum-powered applications, hang
  out at Community Hubs, and see first-hand how Ethereum is already delivering
  real value on the ground.


  ##### Devconnect is also a decentralized event week, where expert teams curate
  focused events around the city. This year, we’re working on refining the
  schedule to minimize overlap, so you can join the high-impact discussions
  relevant to you.

  ## Buenos Aires, Argentina


  #### Ethereum adoption is already very real in Buenos Aires and Argentina.
  People here rely on stablecoins to protect their savings, local government
  institutions experiment with blockchain, and grassroots Ethereum communities
  are thriving. From communities like Ethereum Argentina and Seed Latam to the
  pop-up city Aleph: Ciudad de Crecimiento, Buenos Aires shows a deep commitment
  to Ethereum’s future.


  ##### By bringing Devconnect to BA, we aim to showcase tangible Ethereum
  solutions, celebrate the passionate local builders, and learn from a region
  where crypto isn’t just an idea—it’s part of daily life. We’ll transform
  Palermo into a living Ethereum “World’s Fair,” highlighting how our tech can
  reshape finance, identity, and community building in real-time.

  ### What to expect?


  #### Multiple events, independently organized by the community.&#xA;Each event
  has a unique focus, ranging from beginner-friendly to expert level.

  ## Devcon vs. Devconnect


  #### We, the Ethereum Foundation events team, create two unique events for
  you: Devcon and Devconnect. Both alternate biannually, focus on Ethereum and
  adjacent tech, and move around the globe. BUT, their formats differ:


  ##### **Devconnect** is a decentralized event week where expert Ethereum teams
  curate their own events. At its core is the Devconnect Cowork, with attendees
  moving around the city to attend a few focused, high-impact sessions on topics
  they care about.


  ##### **Devcon**, by contrast, is largely curated by us (with the help of many
  community members) and takes place in a single, massive venue. Over 4 days,
  attendees can explore talks, workshops, Community Hubs, a music stage, cowork
  areas, a decompression room, and much more.
