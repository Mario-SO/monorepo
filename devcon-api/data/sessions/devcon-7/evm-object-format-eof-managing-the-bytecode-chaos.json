  "title": "EVM Object Format (EOF): Managing the Bytecode Chaos",
  "description": "Currently, EVM bytecode, while being powerful and simple, is lacking structure. This leads to many complexities when introducing new EIPs and maintaining backwards compatibility.\r\n\r\nIn this talk, we illustrate some use cases of the EVM Object Format (EOF). Next, we provide a quick overview of the main changes introduced by the EOF and related EIPs, along with code examples. Finally, we discuss potential benefits and drawbacks that could arise with the introduction of EOF",
