  "title": "How To Hallucinate A Server",
  "description": "A Hallucinated Server is a virtual server whose execution is cryptographically simulated by users, using \"multiplayer\" privacy technologies like multi-party computation or fully homomorphic encryption. Today, thanks to recent advancements in MPC and FHE, we have the technology to build the first fully Turing-complete hallucinated servers. We discuss the underlying technologies, and how we've used them to build several proof-of-concept applications.",
