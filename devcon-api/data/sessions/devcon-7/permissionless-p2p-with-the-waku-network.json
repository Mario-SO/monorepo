  "title": "Permissionless P2P with The Waku Network",
  "description": "This workshop will be oriented around showcasing how p2p networks are pivotal for dapps and just Privacy oriented applications. We will show how Waku can be used to strengthen many concerns about censorship resistance and decentralization. Another section of workshop will be about conscious choice of tradeoffs and those that are present in Waku or any other p2p network. We will try to leave you with some patterns that can be implemented into your daily development and reasoning.",
