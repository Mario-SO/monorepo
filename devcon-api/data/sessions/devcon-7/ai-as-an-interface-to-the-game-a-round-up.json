  "title": "AI as an Interface to the Game: A Round-Up",
  "description": "This lightning talk will show how AI can act as an interface to the Ethereum ecosystem, inspired by the concept from Vitalik Buterinâ€™s blog article. We will explore the current state of LLM-based blockchain AI assistants, their UX, capabilities, challenges, and limitations. The talk will cover how in future AI can simplify the complexity of the Ethereum ecosystem for users, and address crucial safety and privacy considerations.",

  "transcript_text": " Hello, my name is Johannes Pfeffer and I founded a company, a project called Hyro that builds human-centric AI agent systems. And I'd like to talk about a few aspects of AI as an interface to blockchain. So in February this year there was this article by Vitalik which spurred this presentation. It's called the promise and challenges of crypto and AI applications. Who of you have read the article? Hands up please. Okay, I see like four or five, right? Well, in the article Vitalik has identified four main categories of AI and crypto intersection, with which I agree a bit and sometimes I disagree. But let's go through them real quick. So he sees AI as a player of the game, as an interface to the game, as the rules of the game, and as the objective of the game. That is these four categories. I will have to speed through the initial ones because this is a lightning talk, but AI as the objective of the game, it means that the goal is to create",
