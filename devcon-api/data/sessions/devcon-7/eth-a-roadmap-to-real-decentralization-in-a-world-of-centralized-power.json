  "title": "ETH++: A roadmap to (real) decentralization in a world of centralized power",
  "description": "Unfortunately, trends in block building and MEV furnish rapid centralization pressures that erode the protocol guarantees we gather here to build for Ethereum. We must now define a roadmap to save proof-of-stake. This requires help from builders, transaction originators, protocol designers, and you. We will demistify the hype on how and if trusted hardware (TEEs) can help us decentralize. Let's focus on geographical diversity and permissionless designs, to bring the world together.",
