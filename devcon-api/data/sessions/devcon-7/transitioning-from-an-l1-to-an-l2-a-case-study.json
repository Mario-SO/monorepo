  "transcript_text": " Hi everyone, my name is Marek Olszewski and once again we're going to be talking about cello's transition from an L1 to an L2. You've probably heard that we're making this big transition and we really hope that we can become a case study for other L1s to follow suit. And so today will be a talk really targeting those other L1s with our learnings. And I tried to make this fun for you all, so I made this in the style of Zelda. Any Zelda players in the audience? Cool, we got a few hands up. Great. Well, hopefully you'll enjoy the slides.",
