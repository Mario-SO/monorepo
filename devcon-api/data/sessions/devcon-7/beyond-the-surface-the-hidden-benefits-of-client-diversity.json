  "title": "Beyond the Surface: The Hidden Benefits of Client Diversity",
  "description": "When people discuss client diversity, they often focus on technical benefits like resilience to DoS attacks or preventing catastrophic errors like finalizing an invalid chain. But there's so much more to it! Client diversity not only spreads the responsibility of maintaining the blockchain across multiple teams but also brings fresh ideas and perspectives into the mix. In this talk, I aim to explore all the hidden benefits of embracing client diversity.",
