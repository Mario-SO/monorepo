  "title": "MUD - How we built an EVM application framework from the ground up",
  "description": "We wanted to accomplish one simple task: put a game—with all its data and logic—on a blockchain. What followed were countless technical challenges, years of efforts, and learnings that are applicable to anyone building complex onchain apps.\r\n\r\nHow should data be structured? How can complex world state stay up-to-date on the client? How do we allow multiple teams to build on one single world, without it all breaking apart? Join us as we share the pitfalls and learnings.",
