  "title": "DAOs and BORGs: blending the best trust-minimization techniques of the onchain and offchain worlds",
  "description": "In his talk, Gabriel will give an overview of the legal challenges faced by DAOs and how ‘making DAOs modular’ with specialized legal wrappers and smart contracts known as ‘cybernetic orgs” (BORGs) can solve these problems. The talk will tie the evolution of DAOs to the modular revolution in blockchain infrastructure and a detailed walk-through of how modified Gnosis SAFEs can be combined with legal entity bylaws to blend the best trust-minimization techniques of the onchain and offchain worlds.",
