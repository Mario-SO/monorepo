  "description": "In this lightning talk I will present three major directions that we need to tackle to make Ethereum Cypherpunk:\r\n1. Against popular trends, I call for increasing block time (instead of making it faster) to increase resilience via better DVT and mixnets - both are struggling with low latency blocks\r\n2. Let's revive the Ethereum world computer, not just financial infrastructure and their implications\r\n3. Rethink [d]app UX entirely - how does resilient human interaction feel like in the digital era?",
