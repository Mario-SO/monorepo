  "description": "In this session we will explore some of the lesser-known facts around contract deployment. To make the presentationÂ accessible to all technical levels, the talk will start by recapping the three ways to start contract deployment (deployment tx, CREATE, CREATE2). Following this, we will delve deeper into the topic and highlight some interesting facts around contract deployment, including what happens when an address already has code, ETH, or state entries at deployment.",
