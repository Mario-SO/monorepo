  "title": "Why VPNs are scams and what to do about it",
  "description": "Existing VPNs are essentially scams. Free VPNs and most centralized VPNs (such as ExpressVPN, owned by Kape) are effectively data harvesting companies.  Decentralized VPNs usually have a few large servers and offer barely any more privacy than centralized VPNs. What is missing is 1) onion-routing packets like Tor 2)  adding noise (fake traffic) 3) censorship-resistance and 4) mixing packets from different users together. We'll explore how technologies work to defeat even AI adversaries.",
