  "title": "ETH Arauca: Emerson's Legacy and the Hope for Change in Vulnerable Communities Through Ethereum",
  "description": "In this talk, we will explore the moving case of ETH Arauca and the brave young activist Emerson, who led the ETH Colombia node and whose life was tragically taken in the exercise of his mission. We will analyze how Ethereum, through its vision of decentralized finance, can act as an engine of transformation in vulnerable communities with conflict contexts. This talk seeks to give visibility to Emerson's legacy, ETH leaders challenges, and highlight the potential of Ethereum to drive real change",
