  "title": "The Next Era: Sequencing and Its Real Impact on App Users",
  "description": "This talk will discuss app sequencing products which were developed to enhance decentralization and security via distributed transaction ordering with independent sequencing (native Mainnet L2 sequencers i.e. Base, OP) and the impact to end users and applications. It will also discuss the tradeoffs of LVR, shared sequencing, and app-specific sequencing.",
