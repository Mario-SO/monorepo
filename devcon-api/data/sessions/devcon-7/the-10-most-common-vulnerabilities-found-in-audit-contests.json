  "description": "This lightning talk offers a quick survival guide for DApp developers and security experts, highlighting the most common vulnerabilities found in audit contests. As these contests are often the final step before mainnet, the identified vulnerabilities have typically been overlooked by multiple developers and auditors. The session includes a link to a guide on fixing each vulnerability and a 2-minute Q&A to explore any of the 10 vulnerabilities in more detail and discuss why they are often missed",
