  "description": "For the past 1.5 years, I've been building fully onchain gamesâ€“games where the entire state is onchain for some reason (have launched 7!). \r\n\r\nThere is lots of cryptographic data floating around the internet. New primitives are allowing all this data to be interoperable with each other... and even verifiable on-chain. \r\n\r\nI'll discuss some of this tech (tls notary, app attest, zkml, etc.) and discuss what new wild games we can build with them.",
