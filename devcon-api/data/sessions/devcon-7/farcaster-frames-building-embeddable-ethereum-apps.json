  "title": "Farcaster frames: building embeddable Ethereum apps",
  "description": "Frames are an open standard for creating embeddable, interactive apps in social media feeds and on the web. They help solve one of the hardest problems for Ethereum dapp developers: distribution. Although frames originated on Farcaster, it's now possible to build cross-platform frames that work on Farcaster, Lens, XMTP, and the open web. In this hands on workshop we'll introduce the core concepts behind frames and build a simple frame app that interacts with a smart contract.",
