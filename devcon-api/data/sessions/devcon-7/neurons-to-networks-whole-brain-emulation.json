  "description": "The pursuit of whole brain emulation (WBE) represents one of humanity's most ambitious scientific endeavors, requiring unprecedented coordination between neuroscience, computer science, and institutional frameworks. This talk examines the evolving landscape of WBE research through the lens of institutional support mechanisms, with particular focus on the pioneering role of the Foresight Institute in fostering early discourse around brain emulation technologies (Fellowships, Prizes, Grants)",
