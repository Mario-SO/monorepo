  "title": "Can we fix MEV?",
  "description": "MEV is problematic today. The MEV supply chain puts centralizing pressure on Ethereum. There’s also an allocation problem; proposers (not apps or users) earn nearly all MEV, though they’re merely protocol agents. Numerous proposed solutions address this (ePBS, EAs, ETs, FOCIL, BRAID...), each with tradeoffs and assumptions about whether MEV is intrinsic to blockchains or extrinsic & preventable. Research is challenging to enter w/o continuous engagement. I’ll provide an overview of the research.",
