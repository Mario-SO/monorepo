  "description": "One of the core themes of this panel is how Programmable Cryptography synergizes with Ethereum. Panelists will discuss questions such as ''Why have we not been able to do everything we've wanted with Ethereum?'' and ''Why have certain kinds of applications - from decentralized social to decentralized games to decentralized finance - not been able to reach their full potential with only consensus technology?''",
