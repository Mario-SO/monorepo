  "title": "Exploring Proof of Personhood: Privacy, Biometrics, and Why It Needs Ethereum.",
  "description": "In this session, Remco Bloemen will explore the urgent need for proof of personhood and privacy in a digital-first world. Using insights from Vitalik’s blogpost 07/23, Remco explains why Ethereum’s trustless infrastructure is key to achieving privacy-preserving identity solutions through technologies like zero-knowledge proofs (ZK) and multi-party computation (MPC). This talk is designed to educate developers on creating equitable digital identity solutions without compromising user privacy.",
