  "title": "Polynomial Commitment Schemes for Zero-Knowledge Proof Systems: A Hands-on Workshop",
  "description": "In this workshop, we will compare three distinct classes of Polynomial Commitment Schemes employed in various zero-knowledge proof systems: pairings-based (e.g., KZG), discrete logarithm-based (e.g., IPA), and hash function-based (e.g., FRI). We will explore their mathematical constructions, properties, and trade-offs. Participants will engage in hands-on proof-of-concept implementations, gaining practical experience of these advanced cryptographic protocols.",
