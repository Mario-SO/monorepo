  "description": "Memory copy operations in EVM are a useful feature, but there are different ways to do. How do they differ? Which is the best?\r\nThe options are:\r\nMLOAD+MSTORE loop\r\nIdentity Precompile\r\nThe new MCOPY opcode\r\nBased on concrete examples we will explain how these options differ. We will use different examples as the amount of bytes copied makes a difference. For all these options we will present gas consumption and code size.\r\nThis way we can compare the different options to copy memory and crown the ult",
