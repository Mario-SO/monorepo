  "description": "Transaction simulation allows users to preview the outcomes of signing a transaction, enabling them to make informed decisions rather than fully trusting the dApp. However, several caveats and risks are associated with relying on simulated transaction outcomes. State changes, differing contract behavior between simulation and on-chain execution, and randomness can all affect the outcome. In this talk, I'll share my experiences and learnings from simulating user transactions over the past 2 years",
