  "title": "Encrypted Mempools: a path to Ethereum L1",
  "description": "This talk will explore the future of encrypted mempools, paving the way to enshrinement on Ethereum L1. Starting from current designs such as Shutter and SUAVE, security assumptions and out-of-protocol infrastructure can be stripped away with cryptography including homomorphic encryption, VDFs, and delay encryption. These approaches would trustlessly bring front running protection and censorship resistance to the protocol.",
