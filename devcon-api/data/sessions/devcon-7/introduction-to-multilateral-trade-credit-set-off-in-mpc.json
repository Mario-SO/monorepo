  "title": "Introduction to Multilateral Trade Credit Set-off in MPC",
  "description": "Multilateral Trade Credit Set-off is a process for collecting outstanding invoices from a network of firms and detecting cycles. A cycle is a circular pattern of due payments that connects businesses. Removing a cycle yields liquidity savings for the firms involved. This process is done by a central agency that collects the invoices and performs the netting. Instead, we leverage MPC to perform the set-ff while preserving the privacy of sensitive financial data of the firms",
