  "title": "VADCOPs: Leveraging STARKs for Tailored Proof Generation",
  "description": "VADCOP is a proving method using STARKs to achieve cost-efficiency by focusing on active parts of the execution trace rather than the entire trace. Traditional modular designs, which divide machines into components and use relational arguments, face inefficiencies due to the padding of unused cells with dummy values. VADCOPs optimize performance by allowing maximum modularity and avoiding unused components, making proof generation precise and efficient without unnecessary redundancy.",

And what this diagram is showing is you've got a set of pages and they're all hash verified. Now, what are the implications of all that process? Well, basically what you end up with is very quick sync performance effectively so the big difference between Eragon to an error Eragon 3 is the amount of time it takes to sync something and this is You see this particularly on large chains so Basically my role in the Eragon team. I mainly work on Polygon rather than Ethereum. So, basically, my role in the Aragon team, I mainly work on Polygon rather than Ethereum.
