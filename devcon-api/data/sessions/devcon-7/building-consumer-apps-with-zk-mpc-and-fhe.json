  "description": "In this panel, members of Cursive, ZK Email, ZKP2P, and TACEO will describe their experience building and enabling consumer applications using programmable cryptography. They will discuss how advances in ZK, MPC, and FHE enable new types of applications to be built, how to get started building cryptographic apps, tradeoffs in tooling, and the challenges and potential pitfalls while using these tools. Finally, they'll share some future ideas for cryptography-centric apps they're excited about!",
