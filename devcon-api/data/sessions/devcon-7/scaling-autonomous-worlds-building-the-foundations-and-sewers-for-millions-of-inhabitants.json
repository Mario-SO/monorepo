  "description": "One tends to think of Ethereum scaling in financial terms—how many transactions per second? What’s the TVL? How much liquidity?\r\n\r\nBut in a possible future where Ethereum applications extend beyond finance, into areas like autonomous worlds, games, and social, what does scaling look like and what challenges await?\r\n\r\nJoin us as we explore challenges, solutions, and open questions in this space—how do we bring latency down despite seconds-long block time? Could we shard an app across multiple chains?",

  "transcript_text": " All right. My name is Tidat. I'm a software engineer at Lattice. And yeah, I'm about to talk about bringing you on our journey, basically building the best infrastructure for autonomous worlds and mod apps. basically building the best infrastructure for autonomous worlds and Mudd apps. Okay, so I will start by talking a little bit, bringing a little bit of context for those who don't know what Mudd is and what are autonomous worlds. I will then kind of describe some design patterns that we learned about while we were essentially solving problems for Mudd apps.",
