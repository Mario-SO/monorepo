  "transcript_text": " So when we think about open and decentralized, I think, you know, you've got your models, not your mind. I'd like to think that that's the equivalent of not your keys, not your crypto. I think open models will run the world. It will be the infrastructure upon which our societies run. And I think, you know, let's make them awesome and let's think about leveraging all this technology and innovation we're thinking about to do that. Because I think open source and decentralized AI has a massive advantage over these centralized ones.",
