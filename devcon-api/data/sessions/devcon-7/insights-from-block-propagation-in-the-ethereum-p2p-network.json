  "description": "Libp2p’s Gossipsub protocol is one of the most critical pieces of the Ethereum protocol stack, disseminating blocks between nodes on time and ensuring that misbehaving nodes are rejected from the network. ProbeLab has studied the performance of Gossipsub in Ethereum’s P2P network, building tooling to monitor block propagations and spot abnormalities.\r\nWe revealed ample space for optimisation in the protocol, which will help define the next steps in Ethereum's roadmap. Come and hear our findings!",
