  "title": "A toolbox for monitoring the health of the Ethereum P2P Network",
  "description": "Monitoring the P2P layer of Web 3.0 networks is extremely critical for the healthy operation of the system, but has been overlooked for quite a while. ProbeLab has developed a suite of open source tools to monitor closely the journey of blocks and messages in the Ethereum network, as well as the operational details of Ethereum nodes. The target is to assess the health of the network as a whole.In this workshop weâ€™ll walk through and demo the details to enable others to benefit from our tooling.",
