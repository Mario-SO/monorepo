  "description": "This talk will be about dynamically available protocols and their properties. LMD-GHOST which is the fork choice rule for Ethereum consensus currently can face ex-ante and re-org attacks. GoldFish and other protocols aim to fix this but they themselves then face problems with asynchrony resilience and subcommittees. \r\nI also want to present possible solutions to these issues and establish some impossibility results that might be useful in consensus research for path towards single slot finality.",
