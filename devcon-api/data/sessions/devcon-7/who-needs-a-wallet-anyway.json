  "description": "This talk confronts the community’s obsession with decentralization purity at the cost of usability. This session explores how to hide the complexities of crypto, enabling seamless integration for users who may not even realize they are using a wallet. We’ll cover simplifying user interactions, making wallets function invisibly, maintaining benefits like permissionless innovation, managing thousands of wallets, and real-world applications. It’s time to push for real, user-friendly innovation.",
