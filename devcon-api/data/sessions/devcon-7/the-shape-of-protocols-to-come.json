  "description": "Ethereum defies easy categorizationâ€”it blends aspects of money, nations, and more, yet doesn't fit neatly into any single category.

This talk explores the fundamental properties of protocols, strategies for navigating them, and how Ethereum can uniquely contribute to this emerging research field.",
