  "title": "Navigating Developer Liability in Open-Source Code",
  "description": "In software development, open-source code has become a cornerstone of innovation and collaboration. However, with this comes the issue of developer liability. As seen by the Tornado Cash case, developers and users can be held liable for how open-source code is used, showing the need for developers to be aware of, and navigate, the legal landscape to mitigate potential risks. This session will demystify the legal implications for developers contributing to and using open-source code projects.",
