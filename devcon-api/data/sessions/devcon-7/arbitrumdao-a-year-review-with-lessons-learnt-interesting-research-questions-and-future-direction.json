  "title": "ArbitrumDAO: A Year Review with Lessons Learnt, Interesting Research Questions & Future Direction",
  "description": "The ArbitrumDAO was born in March 2023.  To date, the DAO has voted on 280+ temperature checks (snapshot), 40+ on-chain proposals (tally) & allocated >400m ARB. We take this time to reflect on a few questions:\r\n\r\n- Why should an L2 care about governance with on-chain voting?\r\n- How is the DAO's organisational structure evolving over time?\r\n- What does a DAO like to vote on? \r\n- Can too much decentralization lead to oscillation? \r\n\r\nFinally, a list of interesting research questions for others to tackle.",
