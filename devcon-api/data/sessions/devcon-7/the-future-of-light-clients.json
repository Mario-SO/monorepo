  "description": "Ethereum has achieved a remarkable feat: production-ready light clients. There are now at least seven light client projects active on Ethereum today.\r\n\r\nHowever, light clients have kept up with Ethereumâ€™s future, Layer 2s. Implementations for layer 2s have been mostly overlooked. This is due to both the low prioritization of work on light clients and significant technical challenges. In this talk, we will discuss the path to layer 2 light clients and our work to bring them to production in Helios.",
