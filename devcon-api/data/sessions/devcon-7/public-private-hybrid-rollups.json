  "description": "We posit that it is a best practice that rollups have privacy capabilities. We'll focus on zero-knowledge and its role in enhancing privacy and how to deal with the need for public state for shared use cases. We'll delve into the interaction between public and private execution environments, detailing how such disparate execution environments can be combined.",
