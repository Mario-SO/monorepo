  "description": "Intents represent a new approach to Web3 interactions. However, the transition from the existing structure to an intent-centric space remains uncertain unless we maintain user familiarity. We conducted experiments on user experience for intents and tested them with a focus group. This talk will explore how we can approach intents in a way that users will adopt more readily by leveraging the latest standards and EIPs, including EIP-7702, ERC-4337, ERC-7579, and ERC-7715.",
