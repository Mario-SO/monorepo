  "description": "Account centric models are inherently faster.\r\n\r\nEthereum operates on a global account based model. This means a global lock occurs any time someone needs to touch a piece of global state, such as an ERC20.\r\n\r\nAn account centric model, instead, creates a new deterministic address or state for each account. This means calls into transfers on ERC20s and dexes can be made in parallel, accelerating speed drastically. It also is more secure.\r\n\r\nIt’s a forgotten mechanism to scale ETH.",
