  "description": "Over the last decade, ZK has been gaining attention due to its applications in verifiable private computation and the scalability of blockchains. The development of general-purpose zkvms powered with STARK/hash-based proof systems have made writing provable applications simpler, abstracting developers from the details of ZK. In this talk, we will explain the basics of hash-based proof systems, different arithmetization schemes and how to prove computations without needing a trusted setup.",
