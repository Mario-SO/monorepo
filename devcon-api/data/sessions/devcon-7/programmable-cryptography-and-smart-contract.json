  "description": "Overview\r\nIn some use cases, developers may want to execute smart contracts based on the results of FHE or MPC execution. This session will introduce several design patterns for such use cases and show how Programmable Cryptography can be applied to dApps.\r\n\r\nIn detail\r\nThe results of FHE executions are encrypted and need to be designed to be processed by smart contracts. In addition, the MPC+ZK-based method can solve the private state problem relatively easily using the conventional SNARK verifier.",
