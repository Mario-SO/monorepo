  "description": "At PSE we have done much ZKP advanced development. From that learning we are building a language and compiler, that is summarizing much of this learning.\r\nWe answer questions like: Are compilers necessary in a zkVM world? What is the role of a compiler in ZKP development?  What are its most common components? How different ways can this problem be approached?\r\nIn this advanced talk, we will learn how we compile arbitrary boolean expressions, or how the Schwartzâ€“Zippel lemma can be used to optimize",
