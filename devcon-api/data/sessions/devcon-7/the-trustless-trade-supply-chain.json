  "description": "Trades are fundamental to defi. Without credibly neutral trade execution – we risk the same centralisation and rent extraction through privileged actors that we have in tradfi.\r\n\r\nToday, the trade supply chain in defi is mostly centralised: Intent auctions, builders, solvers and market makers are handful of off-chain actors with privileged access.\r\n\r\nHowever, a trustless, and decentralised trade supply chain is possible. This talk highlights the current and future technologies that make it possible.",
