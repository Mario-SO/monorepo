  "title": "ZKMPC: Bring public auditability into MPC",
  "description": "In multi-party computation (MPC), participants collaboratively compute without revealing private inputs. To secure MPC on a blockchain, preventing collusion is essential. We developed a \"publicly auditable\" version of SPDZ, a widely-used MPC protocol, that enables third-party verification through zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) collaboratively generated by multiple parties. We will also demonstrate application examples, such as a Game Master-free werewolf game.",
