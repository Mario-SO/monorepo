  "description": "This presentation reviews the basics of token systems design and their onchain game applications. This will be specifically tailored to onchain complicated economic systems and simulating them in interactive notebooks for real-time graphing; aiding in parameter tweaking and finding gaps in systems designs. The goal of this talk will be to begin to bridge the gap between complex token systems designers and onchain game designers.",
