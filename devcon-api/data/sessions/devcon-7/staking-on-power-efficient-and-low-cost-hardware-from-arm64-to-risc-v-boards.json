  "title": "Staking on Power Efficient and Low Cost Hardware: From ARM64 to RISC-V Boards",
  "description": "The entry barrier to staking on Ethereum got lower, as ARM boards, the tooling and OS support have improved massively. We show the current landscape of hardware options and the software stack to go along with it. \r\nAs a glimpse into the future we will talk about RISC-V, an open CPU architecture, present the current state of RISC-V based single board computers. We will discuss the progress we have made to run Ethereum nodes on these boards and the road ahead to optimize clients.",
