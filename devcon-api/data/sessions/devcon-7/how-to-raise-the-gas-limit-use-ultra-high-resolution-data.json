  "title": "How to Raise the Gas Limit: Use Ultra High Resolution Data",
  "description": "Recent advances in EVM data processing enable a more rigorous approach for understanding and enacting Ethereum’s scaling roadmap. In the past, discussions around whether to raise Ethereum’s gas limit have been held back by imprecise terminology and a lack of detailed quantitative evidence. The debate is often “vibes-based”. Leveraging ultra high resolution datasets enables a more scientific understanding of the gas limit, including issues like state growth, hardware bottlenecks, and gas pricing.",
