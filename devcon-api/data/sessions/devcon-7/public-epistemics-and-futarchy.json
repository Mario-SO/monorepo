  "description": "35 years ago I began outlining a vision of how betting markets could offer informed credibly-neutral estimates on far more disputed topics.

Now in the last year, we are seeing substantial crypto-based trials, especially re governance. In this talk, Iâ€™ll paint a picture of where all this could go.",
