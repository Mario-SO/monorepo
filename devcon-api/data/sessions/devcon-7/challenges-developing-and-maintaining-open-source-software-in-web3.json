  "description": "Producing high-quality developer tools for the Web3 ecosystem is a challenging task that requires significant effort (and funding). Many of the best and most used tools started out as a lone hackers side-project, and then evolved into longer-standing projects by being absorbed into a larger companies efforts. In this talk, we'll share RV's open-source tool development story, and discuss what a better future could look like.",
