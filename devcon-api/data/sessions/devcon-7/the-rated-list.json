  "description": "The Rated List construction aims to minimise the number of requests required to complete sampling in Data Availability Sampling (DAS) for Ethereum. This optimisation becomes especially critical in the context of Full DAS, as data production per slot is anticipated to far exceed the current Deneb-Cancun (Dencun) specifications. The Rated List attempts to improve rate of successful sampling against unfavourable network conditions there by reducing the bandwidth consumption of the overall network.",
