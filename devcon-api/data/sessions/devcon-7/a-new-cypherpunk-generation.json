  "description": "How does the 30 year old cypherpunk manifesto compare to our culture now? Is it the safe, or has it lost its relevance?\r\n\r\nThis talk is giving an insight into the current hacking/cracking/pirating culture that is thriving on the internet alongside culture that is cypherpunk. \r\n\r\nA visibility inside a (white&blackhat) environment where people are moving, and what do they do to \"make\" a living. \r\n\r\nWhat can we learn from them? And how can make sure that we do not become the goliath we all hate,",
