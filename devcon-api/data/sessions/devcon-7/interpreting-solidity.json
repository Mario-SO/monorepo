  "description": "In this talk, we present an alternative way of executing Solidity: interpreting it.\r\nFoundry popularized writing more in Solidity, including tests and scripts. However, the compilation model is limiting for some use cases, such as interactive environments or general purpose scripting. We first describe how interpreting can solve many of these limitations, then, we explain how to build such an interpreter, finally, we present a Solidity REPL that we built using this approach: https://eclair.so",
