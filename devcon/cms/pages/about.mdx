  ## **What is Devcon**


  ### Devcon is an intensive introduction for new Ethereum explorers, a global
  family reunion for those already a part of our ecosystem, and a source of
  energy and creativity for all.


  We host Devcon to educate and empower the community to build and use
  decentralized systems. It is a conference for builders of all kinds.


  Our goal is to push the boundaries of possibility in our mission to bring
  decentralized protocols, tools, and culture to the world. Programming covers
  content ranging from the deeply technical to the profoundly human.

for_whom: "## **Devcon is for builders of all kind**\n\nDevcon always had a heavy technical focus to it, and this will remain true this year and into the future (it’s the DEVelopers CONference after all!). Though Ethereum is a technological breakthrough in its own right, its applications reach much further, into digital economy, research, community, art, and beyond.\n\nDevcon is not\_only\_for developers, it is for builders of all kinds: engineers, designers, researchers, infrastructure operators, community organizers, social economists, artists, and more. So we want to invite everyone who is looking to build and create to improve our existing world using Ethereum and decentralized systems.\n"
global_communities: "### We could host Devcon in the same place every year, sure! But we’re working toward achieving a goal of bringing Ethereum to communities around the world, and to places where it can have real impact\_today.\n\n“The difference between Argentina and some of the wealthier countries is that in wealthier places, there are people who are excited about crypto ideas and theory, but people here deeply understand that crypto is solving real problems.”\_— Vitalik Buterin\n\n<Buttons\n  Button={[\n    {\n      text: \"Devcon Archive\",\n      url: \"https://archive.devcon.org\",\n      color: \"green-1\"\n    }\n  ]}\n/>\n"

  Ethereum isn’t merely a technical solution, but a community. While blockchain
  communities in Europe and North America are already strong and vivid, we can
  have a big impact today in newly developing communities.
